Global Terrorism dataset, which has over 191k records of the incidents related to terrorism from 1970 to 2018 is managed by The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, College Park.
It was established in 2005 as a U.S Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence.
Apart from the city and the country, the dataset also specifies the latitude and longitude of the attacks thereby giving accurate locations that can help in data visualization. With the help of abundant features available in this dataset, we can find out the intensity of attacks by region for a particular year, whether there are any temporal or geographical trends in the attacks and the relationships between the characteristics of attacks and their success and failure rates.
Why to choosd to do this is because to study and analyse the different terrorism acts that have taken place in various parts of the world, at different times, problem rise by them are : 
i. The various causes behind terrorism acts.  
ii. different types of terrorism acts.
iii. categories of terrorism acts.
iv. distribution of terrorism acts.
v. statistical conclusions.

- **Motivation:** Understand the underlying causes and patterns of terrorism acts worldwide to inform policy-making, security measures, and international relations.
- **Scope:** Analyze the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between different attributes such as attack type, target type, and success/failure rates of attacks.
- **Impact:** By studying the dataset, gain insights into the dynamics of terrorism over time and geography, aiding in the development of strategies for prevention, response, and mitigation.
- **Challenges:** Address challenges such as data quality issues, missing values, and the complexity of analyzing large-scale, global datasets spanning several decades.
- **Methodology:** Employ data visualization techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure responsible handling of sensitive data related to acts of terrorism and prioritize ethical principles in the analysis and interpretation of results.
- **Future Directions:** Use the findings from the analysis to guide further research, policy interventions, and strategies aimed at combating terrorism and promoting global security and stability.
